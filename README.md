I had fun messing around with this design while learning frontend frameworks. 

## Quick Start

### Using docker (recommended)

```bash
docker run -d --name terminal -p 3000:3000 ghcr.io/m4tt72/terminal
```

### Using npm/yarn

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

3. Run the server:

```bash
yarn dev
```
